## Project Goals
The idea behind this project was to combine a visually appealing quiz with a subject that many would find quite boring and uninteresting in a bid to make the subject more fun to the user. Science and space subjects, many would consider, is not that exciting. However this quiz is a small step to change that.

## Target Audience
The audience I was aiming for was one on a broad spectrum. I wanted people who find space and science interesting to play the quiz, but also people who were less knowledgeable about the subject to give it a go and test themselves to see how many questions they could get correct.

#### Start of the quiz
Throughout the quiz there is a background image of a solar system to relate to what the whole quiz is about. At the start of the quiz there is a large title and a questions to engage the user. The title tells the user what they are playing and the question is a rhetorical one to get the user thinking "Are they ready?". The user has a space to input their name, which is then saved to local storage that will be used later on in the quiz.

#### Instructions
I added an brief instrucions list to outline to the user what the quiz entails and what they can and cannot do. With the background being of dark colors, the instruction box is bright and clear for the user to read.

#### Quiz Section
The quiz is situated within a semi-transparent backgroud that adds contrast to the colors used for the writing, to allow the user to read the questions with ease. The function of the quiz allows the user to select the quiz in which if the user is correct the answer will be highlighted in green. If they are wrong the answer they selected will be highlighted in red and the correct answer shown and highlighted in green. After the user has selected their answer, they are unable to select any other answer and have to progress through the quiz. In bottom left of the quiz there is reference to what number question the user is on and increments up accordingly.

#### Results
Once the user has completed the quiz, the results box comes up offering the total number of questions you have right, a quirky message depending the user was in the correct score range and also the users name in which they submitted at the begging of the quiz. The end button on the results page reloads the page back to the start.
